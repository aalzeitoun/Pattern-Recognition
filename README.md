PATTERN RECOGNITION
==========================================

In this report, we discuss in details some techniques from Pattern Recognition which are widely used. We present their compact explanation, performance evaluation, their complexity, implementation details and advantages over each other. We describe in this report: First, a few techniques about data distribution where we predict and make an analysis about the nature of the data. Second, a few approaches regarding data structure, similarity searching as well as data classification e.g. Least Square, KD-tree and KNN etc. We not only explain these techniques but also provide their detailed and in-depth performance analysis.
Thirdly, we also elaborate how to perform perfect clustering for compact and non-convex data e.g K-means and Spectral Clustering. Furthermore, we also illustrate that how can we reduce the dimensionality of the data and can make our algorithm fast enough without losing any significant information.

For more details about these projects please read my final report, all the solutions of these projects are implemented in Python, to get the source code please contact me by email (below).
